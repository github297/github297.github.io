    <h2>"To Build a Temple"</h2>
<p>Under the direction of the First Presidency, the architects worked to conceive a worthy design.
    
    “I can’t think of any assignment that could come to a Latter-day Saint architect that would be a higher honor than working on a temple for our Heavenly Father.”<br><br>
    
    These are the feelings of Emil B. Fetzer, Church architect and designer of the Provo and Ogden temples. Brother Fetzer, who made initial selection of architects to design the Washington Temple and who was to coordinate their work, had two criteria to follow in selecting the architects: they had to be mature, distinguished men who had proved their professional competence in public careers, and they had to be men of sufficient spiritual stature to be intimately acquainted with the work of a temple. Recommended to and approved by the First Presidency for this assignment were Harold K. Beecher, Henry P. Fetzer, Fred L. Markham, and Keith W. Wilcox.<br><br>
    
    Although these four brethren had never worked together before, they accepted responsibility for designing the temple and became a creative team, warmed by the special spirit of individual inspirations that gradually blended and evolved into one inspired design.<br><br>
    
    Pleased with the functional design of the Provo and Ogden temples, the First Presidency instructed the architects that the Washington Temple was to feature the same innovative single-room-session plan (ordinance rooms arranged around the celestial room); they further specified that it was to be a building of beauty, significance, and distinction.<br><br>
    
    Brother Markham was named chairman, and the work began. Their special spirit was epitomized by two initial procedures the architects adopted: planning sessions opened with prayer, and no votes were taken. Disagreements on any point were discussed until full agreement was reached.</p>
